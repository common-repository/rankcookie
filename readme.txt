This plugin provides a simple way to integrate the Google Tag Manager. It is sufficient to enter the Google Tag Manger ID in the dashboard.

The plugin also provides a cookie banner to obtain the corresponding user consent and saves it as a cookie.

== Description ==
After the consent has been given via the cookie banner, a cookie named \'rankcookie\' with the values ​​\'essential [, statistics, custom]\' is generated.

After the consent has been granted via the cookie banner, the Google Tag Manager is integrated once via the Javascript file \'rankcookie.js\'.
For all subsequent page views, the GTM snippet is integrated into the source text of the page via the PHP file \'rankcookie.php\'.
